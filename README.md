# Principles Of Data Analytics Project
I was assigned this project to analyse the dataset at hand to complete the module Principles of Data Analytics in Semester 1 of the course Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at [ATU Galway](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics)


## About the Project
This project is based around the [Palmer Penguins Dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) and for this project I am being provided an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills that I have acquired through this module to analyse the dataset effectively.

## Tasks

- Create a GitHub repository with a README.md and a .gitignore. Add a Jupyter notebook called penguins.ipynb and add a title to it.
- Find the palmerpenguins data set online and load it into your Jupyter notebook. In your notebook, give an overview of the data set and the variables it contains.
- Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model the variables in the data set in Python, explaining your rationale.
- Create a bar chart of an appropriate variable in the data set. Then create a histogram of an appropriate variable in the data set.
