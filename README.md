## About the Project
This project is based around the [Palmer Penguins Dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) and for this project I am being provided an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills that I have acquired through this module to analyse the dataset effectively.

## Tasks

- Create a GitHub repository with a README.md and a .gitignore. Add a Jupyter notebook called penguins.ipynb and add a title to it.
- Find the palmerpenguins data set online and load it into your Jupyter notebook. In your notebook, give an overview of the data set and the variables it contains.
- Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model the variables in the data set in Python, explaining your rationale.
- Create a bar chart of an appropriate variable in the data set. Then create a histogram of an appropriate variable in the data set.

 ## Palmer Penguins Dataset Analysis

The Palmer Penguins dataset is a collection of data on penguin populations observed near the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

#### Data Description

The dataset contains data for several penguin species, including:
 - Adelie penguin (Adelie)
 - Chinstrap penguin (Chinstrap)
 - Gentoo penguin (Gentoo)
 - Each data point consists of various features for individual penguins, such as:
 - Island: The island where the penguin was observed (Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen)
 - Species: The penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo)
 - Bill Length (mm): Length of the penguin's bill in millimeters
 - Bill Depth (mm): Depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters
 - Flipper Length (mm): Length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters
 - Body Mass (g): Body mass of the penguin in grams
 - Sex: Sex of the penguin (Adult Male, Adult Female, Juvenile)
 - Breeding: Breeding status (Breeding, Non-breeding)
 - Potential Uses

#### The Palmer Penguins dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks, including:

Classification: Classifying penguin species based on their physical measurements.
Regression: Predicting body mass or flipper length based on other features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of features, identifying correlations between features, and visualizing data patterns.
Anomaly Detection: Detecting outliers or unusual data points that might indicate errors or unique penguin characteristics.

When I was struggling with some aspects of this project. I used that ai software [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/). I used this as a guideline to try and understand what issues I was having and then implemented them once I was able to grasp what I was doing.
